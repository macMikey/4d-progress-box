# 4d-progress-box



Component for making 4d's progress box more funner.



## Installing

I prefer to submodule repos like this one because then I can see when there is an update to the component, right in the parent project repo. To do that:

1. Add 4d-progress-box as a submodule to your parent project. I store that in a directory of the parent project called ... **Submodules**. All of my submodules/dependencies go in that folder.
2. Create an alias/shortcut to the *4d-progress-box.4DProject* file in the **Components** folder of the parent project.
